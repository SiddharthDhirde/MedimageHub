            <h2>NBI - Narrow Band Imaging</h2>
            <p>Narrow band imaging is an advance endoscopic imaging technique that is used to enhance the visibility of the blood vessels.<br>
                Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) finds conditions such as colorectal cancer, Barrett's esophagus, and adenomatous polyps by utilizing its unique imaging capabilities that focus on the vascular structures and surface microarchitecture of tissues. Here's how it works for each condition:
            </p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Colorectal Cancer: NBI enhances the visualization of the pit patterns of the mucosa, which are indicative of colorectal lesions. The technique highlights the network of capillary vessels near the surface, allowing for better differentiation between normal and abnormal tissue structures. This helps in identifying lesions that may not be easily visible with conventional white light endoscopy.</li>
                <li>Barrett's Esophagus: NBI provides clearer images of the mucosal surface, allowing for the observation of the boundary between normal squamous cell tissue and Barrett's mucosa. The technique makes it easier to identify areas of intestinal metaplasia, which is crucial for diagnosing Barrett's esophagus and assessing the risk of progression to cancer.</li>
                <li>Adenomatous Polyps: By emphasizing the capillary network and surface microstructure, NBI allows for a more detailed examination of adenomatous polyps. The images produced by NBI are clearer than those obtained using conventional techniques or dye staining, making it easier to detect small polyps and assess their characteristics</li>
                <li>Works on the basis of wave length (blue or green mostly)</li>
                <li>Helps in detecting tumors.</li>
            </ul></p>
